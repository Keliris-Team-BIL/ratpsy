Definitions of premature responding:


1- Anticipatory responses:

   when the rat breaks the fixation/hold period , designated by the code number: 7 in the raw data files.


   The index is = number of aborted fixations to the number of successful fixations (display-stimulus)

                = number of 7s                to number of 4s



2- Premature responding:

   A- When the rats try to initiate a trial during ITI:


   The index is = number of center pokes during ITI

                = number of 15s          during 12s



   B- When the rat can not wait until the penality time elapses:


   The index is = number of center pokes during time-out

                = number of 15s          during 9s
